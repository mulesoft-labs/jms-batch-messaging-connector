Mule JMS Batch Messaging Module
====================

The Mule JMS Batch Messaging Module adds message batching semantics on top of the standard JMS connector.
This module provides message processors to consume and dispatch messages with configurable batch sizes,
control the ACK'ing of  messages in the batches and explicitly closing resources associated with the processing
of the batches.
